      <p>Algonquin college student that comes from Brazil,
         Rio de Janeiro. The things she does when she is 
         being lazy are watching some tv show, YouTube, or 
         TikTok, playing video games, and eating unhealthy 
         food. She prefers to talk about social problems, 
         anime, and the pop world in general. She thinks 
         that almost all the courses included in her program 
         are amazing, but what she enjoys the most are shooting 
         and editing pictures. The animals she likes the most 
         are cats and foxes. Becoming a citizen in Canada is a 
         dream that she constantly has afraid to fail, and thinks 
         that web development is the safest way to find a job.</p>
